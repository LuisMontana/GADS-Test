# GADS-Test
Small Game made for GADS as a test

This is a game inspired by a Wack-A-Mole minigame in Crash bash and the increase camera size mechanic in meditations.

Right after being assigned this test, I looked for minigames to twist their mechanics. 
My mind was instantly reminded of the meditations games (an experiment created by rami ismail) and I found the camera resizing mechanic really interesting, but of 
course that was not enough to justify creating a game, after exploring some minigames in both mario party and crash bash I decided what I thought would adapt best to 
the increasing size would be the wack-a-mole. After that I just mixed it with my love of pirates and voila. A short game made in windows of 4-5 hours daily.

Short Plot:
The biggest treasure convoy in the world has been destroyed by a hurricane. Lady luck smiled upon you as you were the closest to the accident location. 
But word travel fast, and these trecherous waters are filled with dangers. Collect as many as you can before other rivals show up and take away your luck!
